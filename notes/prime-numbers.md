# Prime Numbers

if a number is given and to find if it is a prime number or not -> we can find in o(sqrt(N))
for a range from 1 -> n , the better solution is sieve of eratosthenes with time complexity (o(nlog(logn)))
log(logn) is considered very small value and in some documentations it says the time complexity is o(n)
